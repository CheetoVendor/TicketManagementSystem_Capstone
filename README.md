# TicketManagementSystem_Capstone
<center>Overview</center>

The project was to come up with a program idea that met certain criteria that I will list after a while. 
The project is meant to be a ticket management system for a startup company. My goal with this was to implement some design patterns for practice since I have not done so in previous repositories. Another goal was to learn and implement certain tech that is being used in the industry.

The project consists of the use of: Wpf, Entity Framework, Microsoft SQL Server 2022, MVVM Community Toolkit, etc.

The project contains use of the repository and unit of work patterns with entity as well as dependency injection. 



Task 1

In this task, you will organize ideas for your capstone project so you can create your project more efficiently. In order to start your work on the capstone project, you must discuss your ideas for the project with a course instructor. After you reach an agreement on the topic, you must fill out the top portion of the attached “Software Development Capstone Topic Approval Form” and send it to the course instructor, who must digitally sign it and lock it to prevent further changes to the document. The completed form signed by the course instructor must be uploaded together with the other documents required for this task.

It is the policy of Western Governors University (WGU) that student capstone projects should not be based on or include any proprietary or classified information or material belonging to your employer or any other organization. Such material belongs to this third party and is referred to as “restricted information,” which requires you to obtain the party’s permission to include the work. If your capstone project is based upon and/or includes restricted information, you must submit two additional documents with your Task 1 submission. You must attach the “IT Capstone Release Form" AND a signed letter from the owner stating you have permission to use the restricted information.

Projects involving human subjects or the use of protected data will require IRB approval. Work directly with your Course Instructor if your project includes research that involves human subjects in order to determine whether it requires review by WGU’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Task 2

This task is the design, development, and implementation of the software application that was approved by a course mentor.
